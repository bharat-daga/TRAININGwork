    <p>
        A <i><strong style="color: red;">Train</strong></i> is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally run along a railroad track to transport passengers or cargo. The word "train" comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull" or "to draw".

    <h1>IMAGE3:-SHIPS</h1>
    <p>
        A <i><strong style="color: red;">Ship</strong></i> is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and tradition.

<h1> IMAGE4:-CAR</h1>
<p>
    A <i><strong style="color: red;">Car</strong></i> is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.
